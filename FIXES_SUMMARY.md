# üîß Critical Fixes - PWA Authentication & Reset Budget

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

This document summarizes the fixes for two critical issues:

1. **PWA Authentication Persistence Issue** - Users had to login repeatedly in PWA mode
2. **Reset Budget System Issue** - Reset didn't clear associated expenses and data

---

## üîê Issue #1: PWA Authentication Persistence

### **Problem:**
When users installed the Budget App as a PWA and opened it from the home screen, they had to login repeatedly. The authentication session was not being maintained between app launches.

### **Root Cause:**
The issue was caused by `sameSite: 'Strict'` cookie settings, which don't work properly in PWA standalone mode. When a PWA opens in standalone mode, browsers treat it differently than regular web pages, and strict cookies are not sent with requests.

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Changed Cookie Settings (sameSite: 'Strict' ‚Üí 'Lax')**

Updated all authentication routes to use `sameSite: 'Lax'` instead of `sameSite: 'Strict'`:

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/middleware.ts` - Updated `setSecureCookie()` function
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Updated refresh token cookie
- `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Updated refresh token cookie
- `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts` - Updated refresh token cookie

**Why 'Lax' Works:**
- `Lax` cookies are sent with top-level navigation (like opening a PWA)
- `Strict` cookies are NOT sent when navigating from outside the site
- PWA standalone mode is treated as "outside navigation" by browsers
- `Lax` provides good security while maintaining PWA compatibility

#### **2. Created AuthProvider Component**

Added a new `AuthProvider` component that:
- Automatically refreshes access tokens on app load
- Implements automatic token refresh every 10 minutes
- Checks authentication status when pathname changes
- Redirects to login if refresh fails

**File Created:** `app/components/AuthProvider.tsx`

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Auto-refresh token on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const checkAuth = async () => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
    if (!token) {
      const refreshed = await refreshAccessToken();
      if (!refreshed) {
        router.push('/');
      }
    }
  };
  checkAuth();
}, [pathname, router]);

// Auto-refresh every 10 minutes
const refreshInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  if (token && pathname !== '/') {
    await refreshAccessToken();
  }
}, 10 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### **3. Integrated AuthProvider into App**

Updated `app/layout.tsx` to wrap the entire app with `AuthProvider`:

```typescript
<AuthProvider>
  {children}
  <PWAInstallPrompt />
</AuthProvider>
```

### **How It Works Now:**

1. **User Logs In:**
   - Access token stored in `localStorage`
   - Refresh token stored in HTTP-only cookie (sameSite: 'Lax')

2. **User Closes PWA:**
   - Access token remains in `localStorage`
   - Refresh token cookie persists

3. **User Reopens PWA:**
   - `AuthProvider` checks for access token
   - If missing/expired, automatically calls `/api/auth/refresh`
   - Refresh token cookie is sent (thanks to 'Lax' setting)
   - New access token is generated and stored
   - User stays logged in! ‚úÖ

4. **Background Refresh:**
   - Every 10 minutes, token is automatically refreshed
   - Prevents token expiration during active use
   - Seamless experience for users

### **Testing Results:**

‚úÖ **Browser Mode:** Authentication persists across page refreshes
‚úÖ **PWA Standalone Mode:** Authentication persists when closing/reopening app
‚úÖ **Token Refresh:** Automatic refresh works every 10 minutes
‚úÖ **Security:** HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
‚úÖ **Compatibility:** Works on both iOS and Android PWAs

## üóëÔ∏è Issue #2: Reset Budget System

### **Problem:**
When users clicked "Reset Budget to ‚Çπ0", it only reset the budget amount but didn't clear associated data:
- Expenses for that budget period were still showing
- "Spent" amount was still displayed
- AI insights and alerts related to the old budget were still visible

### **Root Cause:**
The original reset functionality only updated the budget amount to 0, but didn't provide an option to delete the associated expenses. This left orphaned data that confused users during testing.

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Created New Reset Endpoint**

Created a new dedicated endpoint: `/api/budget/reset`

**File Created:** `app/api/budget/reset/route.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Accepts `deleteExpenses` boolean parameter
- Uses Prisma transactions for atomic operations
- Deletes expenses by date range (month/year)
- Returns count of deleted expenses
- Logs audit events for tracking

**Code Highlights:**
```typescript
// Transaction ensures both operations succeed or fail together
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Reset budget to 0
  const budget = await tx.budget.upsert({
    where: { userId_month_year: { userId, month, year } },
    update: { amount: 0 },
    create: { userId, month, year, amount: 0 },
  });

  // Delete expenses if requested
  if (deleteExpenses === true) {
    const startDate = new Date(year, month - 1, 1);
    const endDate = new Date(year, month, 0, 23, 59, 59, 999);
    
    const deleteResult = await tx.expense.deleteMany({
      where: {
        userId,
        date: { gte: startDate, lte: endDate },
      },
    });
    deletedCount = deleteResult.count;
  }

  return { budget, deletedCount };
});
```

#### **2. Enhanced Reset Confirmation Flow**

Implemented a two-step confirmation dialog with clear warnings:

**Step 1: Choose Action**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è RESET BUDGET

Do you want to DELETE ALL EXPENSES for this month along with resetting the budget?

‚Ä¢ Click OK to RESET BUDGET + DELETE ALL EXPENSES
‚Ä¢ Click Cancel to only RESET BUDGET (keep expenses)

This action cannot be undone!
```

**Step 2: Final Confirmation**

If user chose to delete expenses:
```
üóëÔ∏è FINAL CONFIRMATION

You are about to:
‚Ä¢ Reset budget to ‚Çπ0
‚Ä¢ DELETE ALL expenses for this month

This will permanently delete all your expense data!

Are you absolutely sure?
```

If user chose to keep expenses:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIRMATION

You are about to reset your budget to ‚Çπ0.

Your expenses will remain but the budget will be cleared.

Continue?
```

#### **3. Updated Button UI**

Changed button text from "Reset Budget to ‚Çπ0" to "üóëÔ∏è Reset Budget & Clear Data"

Added tooltip: "Reset budget and optionally delete all expenses for this month"

#### **4. Success Feedback**

After successful reset, shows appropriate message:

- **With deleted expenses:** `‚úÖ Success! Budget reset to ‚Çπ0, 5 expense(s) deleted`
- **Without deleting:** `‚úÖ Budget reset to ‚Çπ0`

### **User Flow:**

1. **User clicks "üóëÔ∏è Reset Budget & Clear Data"**
2. **First dialog appears:** Choose to delete expenses or not
3. **Second dialog appears:** Confirm the action
4. **API call:** POST to `/api/budget/reset` with `deleteExpenses` flag
5. **Transaction executes:** Budget reset + optional expense deletion
6. **Success message:** Shows count of deleted expenses
7. **UI refreshes:** Dashboard updates with new data

### **Testing Results:**

‚úÖ **Reset Only:** Budget resets to ‚Çπ0, expenses remain
‚úÖ **Reset + Delete:** Budget resets to ‚Çπ0, all expenses deleted
‚úÖ **Transaction Safety:** Both operations succeed or fail together
‚úÖ **Audit Logging:** All reset actions are logged
‚úÖ **UI Feedback:** Clear success messages with counts
‚úÖ **Data Integrity:** No orphaned data after reset
