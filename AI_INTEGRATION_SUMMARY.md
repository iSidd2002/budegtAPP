### 1. **Smart Expense Categorization** 🎯
- AI analyzes expense descriptions in real-time
- Suggests the best category (Food, Transport, etc.)
- Shows confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- One-click acceptance
- Graceful fallback if AI unavailable

**How it works:**
```
User types: "Whole Foods groceries"
↓
AI analyzes after 800ms
↓
Suggests: Food (High confidence)
↓
User clicks "Accept"
↓
Category auto-filled
```

### 2. **Spending Insights** 📊
- AI analyzes your spending patterns
- Identifies highest spending categories
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Displays on dashboard automatically
- Personalized to your budget

**Example insights:**
- "Your highest spending is Food (₹15,000)"
- "You're on track to stay within budget"
- "Consider reducing Entertainment by ₹2,000"

### 3. **Natural Language Processing** 🗣️
- Extract expense details from descriptions
- Foundation for future voice input
- Handles various input formats

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Be Descriptive**
   - "Whole Foods groceries" → Better than "groceries"
   - "Uber ride" → Better than "ride"
   - "Netflix monthly subscription" → Better than "Netflix"

2. **Consistent Naming**
   - Use same names for recurring expenses
   - Consistent category naming
   - Regular expense tracking

3. **Provide Context**
   - Include merchant name
   - Add expense type
   - Be specific about purpose

### Performance Tips

1. **Debouncing:** AI waits 800ms after you stop typing
2. **Timeout:** If AI takes >3 seconds, it times out gracefully
3. **Offline:** App works without AI (graceful degradation)
4. **Caching:** Insights fetched once per dashboard load

---
