**Example:**
```
Note: "Uber ride to airport"
‚Üì
AI Suggestion: Transport (High confidence)
Reasoning: "Uber is a transportation service"
```

**API Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/ai/suggest-category
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "Bought groceries at Whole Foods",
  "amount": 1250.50
}
