# iOS PWA Authentication Persistence - Complete Solution

## üî¥ **The Root Problem**

iOS Safari has an **aggressive 7-day storage deletion policy** for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):

- **All browser storage gets wiped** (IndexedDB, localStorage, Cache API) if the PWA isn't actively used for approximately 7 days
- **Even sooner deletion** can occur under memory pressure, device restarts, or iOS updates
- **This is by design** - Apple treats PWA storage as temporary/cache-like data, not persistent app data
- **No reliable workaround exists** to prevent iOS from deleting local storage

### Why Previous Solutions Failed

1. **localStorage-based auth** ‚ùå - Deleted by iOS after 7 days
2. **IndexedDB + localStorage dual storage** ‚ùå - Both deleted by iOS after 7 days
3. **Service Worker Cache API** ‚ùå - Also subject to the same 7-day deletion policy

**The fundamental issue**: You **cannot trust iOS to persist any client-side storage** for PWAs.

## ‚úÖ **The Solution: Server-Side Sessions + Keepalive**

Since iOS cannot be trusted to persist local storage, we've implemented a **hybrid approach**:

### **1. Extended Server-Side Sessions (90 Days)**

**Changes Made:**
- Extended session expiry from **7 days ‚Üí 90 days** in the database
- Extended cookie `maxAge` from **7 days ‚Üí 90 days**
- This ensures the server-side session remains valid even if client storage is cleared

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/auth.ts` - Updated `generateSessionExpiry()` to 90 days
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Updated cookie maxAge to 90 days
- `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts` - Updated cookie maxAge to 90 days

**Why 90 days?**
- Gives users a 3-month window to reopen the app
- Balances security with user convenience
- Allows for monthly budget app usage patterns

---

### **2. Session Keepalive Mechanism**

**New Endpoint:** `/api/auth/keepalive`

**Purpose:**
- Updates the session's `updatedAt` timestamp in the database
- Signals to iOS that the PWA is "active"
- Helps prevent aggressive storage eviction (though not guaranteed)

**When It's Called:**
1. **On every app open** - When AuthProvider mounts
2. **When app comes to foreground** - Via `visibilitychange` event listener
3. **After successful token refresh** - Keeps session alive

**Files Created:**
- `app/api/auth/keepalive/route.ts` - New keepalive endpoint

**Files Modified:**
- `app/components/AuthProvider.tsx` - Added `sendKeepalive()` function and visibility change listener

---

### **3. Automatic Token Recovery**

**How It Works:**

1. **User opens PWA after 7+ days**
   - iOS has deleted IndexedDB/localStorage
   - Client has no tokens

2. **AuthProvider detects missing tokens**
   - Attempts to refresh using httpOnly cookie (if still valid)
   - Cookie may persist longer than IndexedDB on iOS

3. **If cookie exists:**
   - `/api/auth/refresh` validates the cookie
   - Returns new access + refresh tokens
   - Tokens stored in IndexedDB/localStorage
   - User stays logged in ‚úÖ

4. **If cookie also deleted:**
   - User redirected to login page
   - Must re-authenticate

---

## üìä **Expected Behavior**

### **Scenario 1: User Opens App Every Few Days**
- ‚úÖ Tokens persist in IndexedDB/localStorage
- ‚úÖ Keepalive prevents storage deletion (best effort)
- ‚úÖ User stays logged in indefinitely

### **Scenario 2: User Opens App After 7-14 Days**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IndexedDB/localStorage cleared by iOS
- ‚úÖ httpOnly cookie may still exist
- ‚úÖ AuthProvider auto-refreshes tokens from cookie
- ‚úÖ User stays logged in (seamless recovery)

### **Scenario 3: User Opens App After 30+ Days**
- ‚ùå All storage cleared (IndexedDB, localStorage, cookies)
- ‚ùå No tokens available
- ‚ùå User must login again

### **Scenario 4: User Opens App After 90+ Days**
- ‚ùå Server-side session expired
- ‚ùå User must login again

## üß™ **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Normal Usage (Daily/Weekly)**
1. Login to the app on iPhone
2. Add to Home Screen
3. Use the app normally for a few days
4. Close and reopen from home screen
5. **Expected**: Should stay logged in

### **Test 2: Storage Deletion Simulation**
1. Login to the app on iPhone
2. Add to Home Screen
3. Open Safari Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Website Data
4. Find your app and delete its data
5. Reopen PWA from home screen
6. **Expected**: Should auto-recover and stay logged in (if within 90 days)

### **Test 3: Long Inactivity (7+ Days)**
1. Login to the app on iPhone
2. Add to Home Screen
3. **Don't open the app for 7-10 days**
4. Reopen PWA from home screen
5. **Expected**: 
   - If cookies persist: Auto-recovery, stays logged in
   - If cookies deleted: Redirected to login

### **Test 4: Check Console Logs**
Open Safari Web Inspector (Mac ‚Üí iPhone USB):
```
[AuthProvider] Checking auth on pathname: /dashboard
[AuthProvider] Has access token: false
[AuthProvider] Attempting token refresh...
[Refresh API] Using refreshToken from: cookie
[AuthProvider] Token refreshed successfully
[AuthProvider] Sending keepalive ping...
[AuthProvider] Keepalive successful
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Session Keepalive Flow**

```
User Opens PWA
     ‚Üì
AuthProvider Mounts
     ‚Üì
checkAuth() Called
     ‚Üì
Token Valid? ‚Üí YES ‚Üí sendKeepalive()
     ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
     NO              POST /api/auth/keepalive
     ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
refreshAccessToken()   Update session.updatedAt
     ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
sendKeepalive()       Return success
```

### **Visibility Change Listener**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', async () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    // App came to foreground
    await sendKeepalive();
  }
});
```

**Why This Matters:**
- iOS PWAs lose focus when user switches apps
- When user returns, we immediately ping the server
- Signals "active usage" to iOS
- May help prevent storage eviction (not guaranteed)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Limitations**

### **What This Solution DOES:**
‚úÖ Extends server-side session to 90 days
‚úÖ Provides automatic token recovery via cookies
‚úÖ Sends keepalive signals to maintain "active" status
‚úÖ Improves user experience for regular users

### **What This Solution CANNOT DO:**
‚ùå **Prevent iOS from deleting storage** - This is an iOS platform limitation
‚ùå **Guarantee indefinite persistence** - iOS can still clear storage anytime
‚ùå **Work offline after storage deletion** - Requires internet to recover tokens
‚ùå **Bypass Apple's PWA restrictions** - Fundamental platform constraint

## üöÄ **Deployment Checklist**

- [x] Extended session expiry to 90 days
- [x] Extended cookie maxAge to 90 days
- [x] Created `/api/auth/keepalive` endpoint
- [x] Added keepalive calls to AuthProvider
- [x] Added visibility change listener
- [x] Tested build successfully

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to production (Vercel)
2. Test on real iPhone device
3. Monitor console logs for keepalive activity
4. Test after 7+ days of inactivity
5. Gather user feedback

---

## üìù **User Communication**

**What to tell users:**

> "For the best experience on iPhone, please open the Budget App at least once every 2-3 weeks. This helps keep you logged in and ensures your data stays synced."

**Why this is necessary:**
- iOS has strict storage policies for web apps
- Regular usage helps maintain your session
- This is a platform limitation, not an app bug

---

## üîç **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Server-Side Logs to Monitor:**
```
[Keepalive] Updated X sessions for user Y
[Refresh API] Using refreshToken from: cookie
[Refresh API] Session found: true
```

### **Client-Side Logs to Monitor:**
```
[AuthProvider] Sending keepalive ping...
[AuthProvider] Keepalive successful
[AuthProvider] App became visible, sending keepalive...
```

### **Signs of Success:**
- Users stay logged in for weeks/months
- Keepalive logs appear regularly
- Token refresh from cookies works

### **Signs of Issues:**
- Users complain about frequent logouts
- No keepalive logs in console
- Refresh always fails (no cookie)

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

This solution provides the **best possible authentication persistence** for iOS PWAs given Apple's platform constraints. While we cannot prevent iOS from deleting storage, we've implemented:

1. **Long-lived server sessions** (90 days)
2. **Automatic token recovery** via cookies
3. **Keepalive mechanism** to signal active usage
4. **Visibility change detection** for foreground events

**Result**: Users should stay logged in for weeks/months with regular usage, with automatic recovery if storage is cleared within the 90-day window.
